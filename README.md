RNN interpretation of MinION raw signal using Tensorflow

Scripts for the generation of MinION training reads based on real reads, with an option to oversample homopolymer stretches, training read simulation and the training of recurrent neural networks to detect homopolymer stretches. 

Please note that homopolymer stretches are detected with low sensitivty, as also stated in the thesis for which these scripts were written.
